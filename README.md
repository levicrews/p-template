This repository contains a template for research projects.
It is designed to abide by Patrick Ball's [principle of data processing](https://youtu.be/ZSunU9GQdcI),
namely that projects should consist of chunks of work called **tasks** that are [self-contained and self-documenting](https://hrdag.org/2016/06/14/the-task-is-a-quantum-of-workflow/).
Check out the Wiki to find out more and get started.
